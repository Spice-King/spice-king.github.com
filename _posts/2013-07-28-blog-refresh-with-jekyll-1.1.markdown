I've desided to try to get back into blogging. I'm not sure that I want to import my old posts, but with the power of Git, I've not lost them. One thing is sure, I need to make my own layouts... Well, that is something for me to play with later and post about now.

I'll mess with new layouts in another branch, might even just a local one. I'm far too rusty in my HTML usage. Which reminds me, I've got to get around to oiling my bike chain.
