I have been busy with a number of things the past few days, mostly dealing with my lack of a real job and the garage sale the other day.

Tomorrow, Monday, I resolved my self to go to the youth job clinic and get a little bit of advice over my résumé as it could use some work. Hours at my job at a drive-in food place are getting a little thin, along with my wallet. I hope to get a decent job what will support me for the time being.

On to Minecraft, and mostly the SMP server I play on, [Terris](http://terrismc.info). I have been spending far too much time on in the past few days.

I have gotten one half of my big project done, with a tower to go on it at some point, I'm still working out how to style the tower right now. I know a few people are wanting me gone from the plot of land I've taken up since I got on Terris, I'm sorry, but you can spend a few weeks longer with that hole wide open in the Cloud City Project.

I plan to bling out my living quarters with some of the stuff VengefulFruits has given me (thanks dude!) and build one heck of a tower for me to crash in. And for some friends to visit at times.

As for people who use my Bukkit plugins, I have not forgotten you guys in the least. Time for codeine has been limited, but I do plan to keep at it, so as long as I'm not harming my self over it. Mostly, being almost job less and getting sucked into a bunch of coding for a day does not work anymore.

And for the blog and web design people, I will be looking at redoing my theme for this blog, a little more Minecraft needs to be here.

This has become quite the post in the end, but I think I've covered most of what I wish to say, for now. And I'll say it right now, it's still the third right now here, just kinda late.
