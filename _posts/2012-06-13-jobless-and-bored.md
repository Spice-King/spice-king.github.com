Bored, bored, bored, bored, bored, bored, bored, bored, bored... Oh sorry, did not stop thinking about how bored I am when I started this post. I'm running a Tekkit server at _50.31.24.34:25565_ which runs Tekkit **3.0.4/3.0.3**, but have not had the time with internet to play on it much. In fact, I need to stay a way from MineCraft stuff, Bukkit coding, build projects, etc. Sucks me in, you know? The time is better spent trying to get a real job that I can work as 9-5.

Anyway, I plan to get this blog re-skinned some time, with out most of Jekyll-Bootstrap. I plan on a MineCraft like style, but leaving room for Bukkit, Java, and what ever else I need to leave room for. I also plan on having a project page with all my projects in there with info on them. Will be rather bare for now, but will fill up over time.

Instead I leave you with a picture of my sleeping dog, Willow:

Yes, she sleeps like that all the time.
