Hey, I have a blog now! How about that?

This blog will be filled with code and the ramblings of a cook! I code with Java for making plugins for Bukkit. Maven is one of my favorite tools to deal with Java. I have made the plugin SpoutWallet and I'll be working on more as time allows. I'm also looking at a little MineCraft modding with MCP, ModLoader, and Forge, but not for some time.

Not a half bad for the first blog post, eh? And yes, I'm Canadian!
